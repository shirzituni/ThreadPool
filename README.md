# ThreadPool
A simple Thread Pool.
 A thread pool is a design pattern where a number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. 
 Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. 
 As soon as a thread completes its task, it will request the next task from the queue until all tasks have been completed. 
 The thread will then sleep until there are new tasks available.
 Use Makefile to compile the files. ./a.out -> will run the project.
 Finally, the program will print "hello" 5 times.
